# Arabic-Diacritic-NLP-Project

In this repo you can find an implementation for Arabic diacritic classifier using encoder decoder approach:

1. First implementation using RNNs
2. Second implementation using Transformers (To do)

Also, you can find the baseline model to compare its results with the encoder decoder approach.

You can find all teh details about the baseline model and more using this [Link](https://github.com/Senior-Team-2023/Arabic_text_diacritization_Project.git)
